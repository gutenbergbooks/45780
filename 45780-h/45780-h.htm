<i>if we retire, our youths are lost in wandring; in emulation we</i>
<i>shall grow old men, and feeble, which is the scorn of love, and</i>
<i>rust of honour, and so return more fit to wed our Sepulchers, than</i>
<i>the Saint we aim at; let us therefore make our journey short, and</i>
<i>our hearts ready, and with our swords in our hands put it to fortune,</i>

<span class="i0">I grant ye <i>Roderigo</i> is an out-Law.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An easie composition calls him in again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is a valiant man, and he is a rich man,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She'l like him ten times better. She'l doat upon him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ere they come to grapling, run mad for him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there is another in the wind, some Castrel<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That fellow I have seen her gaze upon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turn, and gaze again, and make such offers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if she would shoot her eyes like Meteors at him:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that cause stands removed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Condition and Complexion it please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She shall please me I am sure; Those men are fools<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That make their eyes their choosers, not their needs.<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Lod.</i> Yes if I could have both, but since they are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wishes so near impossibilities,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me have that that may be.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Piso.</i> If it were so,<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Lod.</i> No I should not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I believe those mad that seek vexations.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Wife, though she be honest, is a trouble,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had I a Wife as fair as <i>Hellen</i> was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That drew so many Cuckolds to her cause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These eyes should see another in my Saddle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere I believe my beast would carry double.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">(Which he shall find too busie, if he seek 'em)<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Lod.</i> Faith thou hast found out one I must confess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would stagger my best patience: From that woman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I would bless my self from plagues and surfeits,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Men of war at Sea, from storms, and quicksands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From hearing Treason and concealing it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From daring of a Madman, or a Drunkard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Heresie, ill Wine, and stumbling post Horse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So would I pray each morning, and each night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(And if I said each hour, I should not lye)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be delivered of all these in one,<br /></span>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p><i>In the following references to the text the lines are numbered from the top of the</i>
<i>page, including titles, acts, stage directions, &amp;c., but not, of course, the</i>
<i>headline or mere 'rules.' Where, as in the lists of Persons Represented,</i>
<i>there are double columns, the right-hand column is numbered after the left.</i></p></div>

<p>It has not been thought necessary to record the correction of every turned
letter nor the substitution of marks of interrogation for marks of exclamation
and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. Full-stops have been silently inserted at the ends of speeches
and each fresh speaker has been given the dignity of a fresh line: in the
double-columned folio the speeches are frequently run on. Misprints in the
Quartos and the First Folio are recorded when they appear to be interesting.
A word or two from the printed text is attached to the variants recorded below
in cases where the variant, by itself, would not be sufficiently clear.</p>
